What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do this?

When you initialize a repository, it creates an empty bank to where you
can save you future commits. You need to do this for that reason- So 
you have somewhere to save the future commits of the files within the 
current directory.



How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a space kind of in between the repository and the
working directory. The folder in which you're currently working is
what is the working directory and the repository is where your commits
of the files on which you're working will go. You essentially take 
you current commits for the file out of the working directory and 
place them into the staging area to prep them to store into the 
repository. This may be valuable in the case the files change in the 
working directory. I'm not actually too sure, yet. Maybe it's valuable
in the case you're not sure if you want to commit this edition of the
file, yet.
